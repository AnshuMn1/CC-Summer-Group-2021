Part 4 Episode 1/2: Binary + Ternary Search
=====

**Binary Search** is one of the most powerful techniques that exist that can solve a variety of problems of even the highest difficulty. It is **highly** recommended that you truly understand the core concept behind Binary Search by reading the following tutorials:

3. [Iterative Binary Search using Jumps](https://www.topcoder.com/blog/binary-stride-a-variant-on-binary-search/)

**Ternary Search** is an extension of Binary Search that allows you to locate minima/maxima for [Unimodal Functions.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unimodality#:~:text=A%20common%20definition%20is%20as,Proving%20unimodality%20is%20often%20hard.)
