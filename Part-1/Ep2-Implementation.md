Part 1 Episode 2/4: Implementation based problems
=====

Implementation problems do not rely on the knowledge of complex data structures or algorithms. On the contrary, they rely on the usage of pure logic and intuition.

There isn't really a way to teach how to solve implementation problems and the only way to get better at them is to solve implementation based problems.
