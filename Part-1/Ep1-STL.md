Part 1 Episode 1/4: C++ Standard Template Library
=====

The C++ Standard Template Library (STL) was briefly touched upon in Week 0. We shall go into more depth about the STL in this article.

So what is this big deal about the STL? The [C++ STL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Template_Library) is a collection of C++ template classes that implement common programming data structures and algorithms.

Why is it important to know the STL? Simple, they make your life a **lot** easier by providing inbuilt implementations of common data structures such as Sets, Hashmaps, Stacks, Queues, Priority Queues, Linked Lists and so on.

In addition to that, the STL also provides implementations of various algorithms such as sorting containers, reversing containers, binary search, cumulative sum of elements, generating permutations and so on.
