Part 1 Episode 4/4: Greedy Algorithms
=====

As one might have understood from the title, a [Greedy Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greedy_algorithm) is one that picks the **locally** optimal solution at each step of the algorithm.

What this means is that the algorithm does not care if the locally optimal solution is not globally optimal and goes ahead and picks the locally optimal solution **anyways**.

Thus, it is important for you, the programmer, to decide if a greedy strategy is the **globally** optimal strategy and only once you are able to prove that statement with a certain degree of confidence, you may go ahead and implement a greedy algorithm.

Here are some practice problems that can be solved using the greedy approach:
