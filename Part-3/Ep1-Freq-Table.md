Part 3 Episode 1/3: Frequency Tables
=====

Frequency tables are generally used to keep track of how many times a certain element occurs within a set of elements.

Note that sometimes, the array elements are too large and you can't always use a **vector** to maintain the count. In such cases, you can use a **map** or **unordered_map** to achieve the same result.
