Part 2 Episode 2/4: Prime Factorization and Prime Sieve
=====

All the factors of a number n can be efficiently calculated in O(sqrt(N)) time.

Furthermore, one can find the prime factorization of a number as well in O(sqrt(N)) time.

A very efficient way to find **all** the prime factors less than or equal to a number N in O(N log(log(N))) is to use the Sieve of Eratosthenes.

-----

Another useful trick to know is that it is possible to factor a number in log(N) time if you are allowed to do O(N log(log(N))) pre processing.
