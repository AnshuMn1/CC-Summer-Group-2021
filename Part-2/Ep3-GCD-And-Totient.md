Euclidean GCD Algorithm
----

Tutorial: [Euclidean Algorithm for GCD](https://cp-algorithms.com/algebra/euclid-algorithm.html)

A very useful inbuilt function in `C++` is the [std::gcd](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/numeric/gcd) function in C++ to calculate the GCD of two numbers.

Euler Totient Function
----

Being defined for an integer n as the number of integer less than or equal to n and co-prime with n, the totient function is an important one to read about.
