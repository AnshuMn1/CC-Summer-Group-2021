Part 0 Episode 1/3: Gearing Up
=====

Before you jump into competitive programming, there are a few things you might want to look at:

Setting up an IDE
-----
You could use an text editor of your choice, such as Vim or VS Code or Sublime Text.

__Sublime Text__ is our personal text editor of choice due to it's speed and minimalist interface.

You may also choose to look at the following:

Choosing a Language
-----
__C++__ and __Java__ are the most commonly used languages due to their 'speed' of execution which is an important factor in competitive programming.

Here's a short overview on both sides of the debate:

1. __Speed__: C++ is certainly faster than Java but the difference isn't large enough to cause substantial issues unless the time constraints are really tight.
2. __Functionalities__: Java provides certain in-built capabilities through which we can avoid writing complex code(for example - BigInteger Class). However, C++ posesses the superior Standard Template Library (STL) that allows you to easily implement simple and complex Data Structures and Algorithms.
3. __Verbosity__: Java is more verbose and so it might take more time writing in Java code for simple programs.

C++ Standard Template Library (STL)
-----
The C++ STL is a huge library of useful functions and it is almost imperative for every C++ competitive programmer to be familiar with the STL.
